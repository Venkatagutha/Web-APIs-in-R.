# Web-APIs-in-R.


Here I am trying to get information of planet
"Alderaan" from star wars.

Packages:
httr- good package for making requests
JSONLite and XML- parses http responses

And then with the help of tidyr and dplyr we 
can perform further operation to be used for
analysis and visualisations
